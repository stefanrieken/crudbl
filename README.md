# CruDBl : CRUD dialog and DB by means of LocalStorage

Checkout this repository and browse to index.html to see it work.
(Local JS execution must be allowed.)

Change model.js (and the setup code in index.html) to create your own database.
The dialogs follow automagically.

Delete the ' localStorage.clear(); ' statement in index.html and your database
will remain permanent within your browser.

Next steps:

- Adding CSS

- Support for list data types

- Packing for mobile use

- Gamification api?
