# CruDBl : CRUD dialog and DB by means of LocalStorage

Checkout this repository and browse to index.html to see it work.
(Local JS execution must be allowed.)

Change model.js to create your own database. The dialogs follow automagically.
See also model2.js for a second example model.

Delete the first ' localStorage.clear(); ' statement from the model.js to have
your database remain permanent within your browser.

CRUDBl has proven to be easily wrapped inside an Android WebView with database,
DOM storage and of course Javascript settings enabled to form an Android app.
